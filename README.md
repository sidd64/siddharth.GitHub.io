## Welcome to my GitHub website

**Q3. Go to the awesome-datascience GitHub https://GitHub.com/bulutyazilim/awesome-
datascience. From the “Data Sets” list, select one data set that interests you. Introduce
the data set on your website. Make sure you include its URL. Also describe some
potential applications for the data set.**
 
url: [r/datasets](https://www.reddit.com/r/datasets/) 

When going through the datasets list, r/datasets caught my eye. r/datasets(subreddit) is a community on Reddit. On the subreddit, users post everything and anything pertaining to datasets. 
Posts on the subreddit are categorized into datasets, mock datasets, API, code, survey, resource, discussions and requests. All of the posts are moderated on the community hence spam and repetitive posts are deleted. 
However, in order to post on the subreddit, users must: 
1.	link to the original source, 
2.	label all artificial datasets (i.e., a mock dataset which is not produced by actual measurements)
3.	and finally all paid datasets must also be labelled as paid

r/datasets is a healthy community of active users, who post, comment and discuss. We can find posts on datasets and analysis performed by the poster, users on the community can comment on the post to elaborate on the analysis or verify the authenticity of the datasets. 
This community is categorized, moderated, and it is open and free for everybody to use and take part in. Such a community of easily accessible and verified data is extremely useful for beginners and professional data analysts alike.

Some of the application of datasets and analysis talked about on the subreddit are: 

•	a Tinder experiment about the priority of the profiles displayed. The user posted their experiment procedure, trial runs and a link to the YouTube video explaining how the video was run. And in the comment section other users discussed test strategy and experiment hypothesis. There were discussions about methods of collection of likes and dislikes data, and location data.
	 
•	One of the users posted a question about using dataset for a project in real estate. The user was asking help about acquiring datasets regarding rent, location etc. in America. There was a very helpful discussion in the comment section about gathering web data, some mentioned various ways to perform web scraping for data, some mentioned free datasets from department of urban development and one user also commented about a free, creative commons licensed database of US home sales.

**Q4.Introduce ONE selected “free-data-science-book” with its URL and author/institute

 “The Data Journalism Handbook” written by Jonathan Gray, Liliana Bounegru, and Lucy Chambers, is a great read for data analysis enthusiasts, who are interested in data journalism and storytelling with data and data visualization. Data journalists create engaging stories by condensing massive and complex datasets into easy to read infographics.  
 
 Multiple case studies and numerous examples presented in this book, provides the readers with an idea of real world applications of data analytics techniques. One of the key aspects of data journalism is transparency. The readers can download and interact with the data used in the infographic and the story. When users and readers are able to trace the story back to the source using the data, they can easily verify the authenticity of the story published. 
 
 The book also talks about the challenges involved in data gathering, cleaning and data visualization. The book explains, with examples, about how understanding the data is vital as not asking the right questions will lead us to perform unnecessary analysis and draw futile inferences. This book provides the readers with sufficient context to understand all the required concepts.
