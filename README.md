>When going through the datasets list, r/datasets caught my eye. r/datasets(subreddit) is a community on Reddit. On the subreddit, users post everything and anything pertaining to datasets. 
>Posts on the subreddit are categorized into datasets, mock datasets, API, code, survey, resource, discussions and requests. All of the posts are moderated on the community hence spam and repetitive posts are deleted. 
>
>r/datasets is a healthy community of active users, who post, comment and discuss. We can find posts on datasets and analysis performed by the poster, users on the community can comment on the post to elaborate on the analysis or verify the authenticity of the datasets. 
>
>This community is categorized, moderated, and it is open and free for everybody to use and take part in. Such a community of easily accessible and verified data is extremely useful for beginners and professional data analysts alike.

>Applications of the dataset: 
>
>>   This dataset can be used to build a classification model that can categorize the job titles based on the job description. 
>
>>   Based on the skill level specified for each of the job descriptions, this dataset can be used to build a model to establish the minimum skill level required by      an applicant.
>
>>   Based on the location data and the skill level required, this dataset can be used to determine the demand for different kinds of jobs where it would be easier      for an applicant to apply for the job.
